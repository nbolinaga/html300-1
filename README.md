SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization, which is the practice of increasing the quantity and quality of traffic to your website through organic search engine results.

Quantity of traffic. Simple, the amount of people clicking on your site.

Quality of traffic. You can attract all the visitors in the world, but if they're coming to your site because of a mistaken recommendation or you dont fullfill their questions that is not quality traffic. Instead you want to attract visitors who are genuinely interested in products that you offer.

Organic results. Traffic is any traffic that you don't have to pay for.

SEO work by using a "crawler" that goes through all your website and brings back the data to the search engine to build an index, that index is later used for when a person is looking for something, if their search matches something on your index then your site is shown to them

If I want my website to compete with other video game news websites and not the get buried with all the others, which are by far bigger and have more money behind them, I should focus more on the fact that mine compiles the news into want place instead of writing my own articles. I should try and use more keywords that describe my website in detail and focus less on more generic words like "news, video games, articles, etc", maybe use keywords like "compiler, compile, organize, arrange, sort out, " 

Using analytics could help me define what people that click on my website are looking for and what the retation rate is. It could also help me see what kind of user is visiting my site (age, location, etc) to better suit their needs in the future.
